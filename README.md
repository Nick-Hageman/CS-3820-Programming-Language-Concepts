### Programming Language Concepts

This course studies issues in programming language design and implementation. Language features like statically scoped variables, higher-order functions, static type-checking, recursion and pattern-matching are considered, from the points of view of both language users and language creators. The class usually introduces a new advanced programming language, typically in the paradigm known as functional programming; examples include OCaml, Rust, Haskell, Agda, Racket, and others. Other topics considered may include, on the implementation side, garbage collection, tail recursion, parsing and grammars; and advanced declarative programming including logic programming or computer theorem-proving.
